# ============================================
# LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================

long_term:
  1. "Maintain bilingual keywords (German + English) for all disciplines"
  2. "Add synonyms and related terms regularly (quarterly review)"
  3. "Monitor modern terminology (DevOps, COVID-19, NFTs, etc.)"
  4. "Use LLM-based classification as primary, keywords as fallback"
  5. "Log failed classifications to identify missing keywords"
  6. "Implement fuzzy matching for typos (e.g., 'devops' vs 'dev ops')"
